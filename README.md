# Hangman Game-python

This is a Python version of the traditional Hangman game. The objective is for the player to guess a hidden Sports name by suggesting letters one at a time. With each incorrect guess, the player comes closer to a figurative "hanging," and they have a limited number of wrong guesses before the game is over.

## Key Features:

- **Random Word Selection:** The game picks a random word from a preset list, ensuring each round is unique.
- **Progress Display:** Reveals correctly guessed letters, providing visual feedback on the player's progress.
- **Incorrect Guesses and Attempts Tracking:** Keeps track of wrong guesses and shows how many attempts remain.
- **Simple Interface:** Features a text-based interface that is intuitive and easy to use.
- **Beginner-Friendly Code:** The implementation is clear, making it accessible for beginners to understand, modify, or enhance.

**Requirements:** 
Python 3.x

**How to Play:**
Clone the repository to your local system.
Run the hangman.py file using Python.
Start guessing letters until you either solve the word or run out of attempts!
